        <h1>EverHome: The Effectiveness of Quest-Based Gameplay for Combating Stress</h1>
        <h2>Rachel Wagner</h2>
        <h3>CS 464 Spring 2022</h3>
        <h1>Abstract</h1>
        <p>The growing awareness of mental health illnesses has led to many researching ways to help treat those suffering. 
            One of those areas of research is "serious games," which are games developed for a purpose other than entertainment. 
            There have been great strides made in this area, but one of questions not yet answered is what kind of role genre plays. 
            The purpose of this study was to determine if genre does have an effect on combating symptoms of mental illness, namely stress. 
            EverHome, a quest-based role-playing game (RPG), was developed and a user evaluation was conducted to see what connection could be draw been genre and stress relief. 
            Of the thirteen participants, almost seventy percent reported relief from their stress. 
            These findings indicate their quest-based gameplay does provide players with relief from stress but does not indicate much else.</p>
        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>The concept of ``serious games'' has become an established field of study, 
            stretching across areas such as education, defense, health care, engineering, politics, and mental health. 
            After years of studying the effects of games on mental health purely through surveys, 
            the development of serious games aimed at treating the symptoms of mental illness has been ramping up in recent years.
            There are still many questions about these serious games that need answering.</p>
        <p>In the advent of the Covid-19 Pandemic, mental health issues became an even bigger threat than they were in the past. 
            Feelings of isolation, anxiety, and depression were sure to rise from the need to quarantine in Spring 2020. 
            Around the start of quarantine, <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> was released, 
            and though it was not designed to be a serious game, people got more out of the game than just entertainment.</p>
        <p><em>New Horizons</em> became a lifeline to many people because it provided people with not only an escape from the 
            dark state of the world but also the ability to hang out with their friends by exploring each other's islands. 
            Even without interacting with real-life friends through the game, interacting with the game's characters was 
            effective in combating feelings of loneliness. This begs the question, 
            "How does genre change the effectiveness of a game's ability to combat stress?"</p>
        <h1>Methodology</h1>
        <h2>Game Design</h2>
        <p>EverHome is a quest-based RPG. 
            Design choices for the game are focused on providing a pleasant setting with bright colors and peaceful sound design. 
            The goal of the game is to complete quests for the townsfolk. 
            The main objective, or quest, of the game is to complete all of the villagers' quest. 
            There are six villagers in total and each has a specific and unique quest based on their personality or livelihood.</p>
        <p>With simple quests to complete, the game is meant to alleviate stress by distracting players from whatever 
            difficulties they are facing in life. It is also meant to help the player feel a sense of accomplishment by 
            allowing them to complete simple tasks. In combination with the pleasant atmosphere that is created through 
            the graphics and sound design, the easy nature of the game should successfully combat stress.</p>
        <h2>Experiment Design</h2>
        <p>Thirteen participants were asked to complete a user evaluation. First, the participants completed Part One of 
            the user evaluation survey to collect their demographics(age, gender, etc.) and their average, non-agitated stress 
            level. Then, they were asked to do something they considered particularly stressful, whether that is work, school, 
            watching the news, etc. This choice was made to better mimic real life. Once they became stressed, they had to 
            complete Part Two of the survey to say how stressed they got. Then, they played the game through to completion, 
            which should take less than ten minutes. After completing the game, they answered the rest of the survey questions, 
            Part Three, about how the game reduced (or did not reduce) their stress with some questions targeted at how particular 
            aspects of the game, like genre and audio/visual design, aided in stress reduction.</p>
        <h1>Results</h1>
        <p>Of the ten male participants, only sixty percent reported a decrease in stress level after playing the game with the 
            other forty reporting no change. The highest change in stress level was a difference of four while the lowest was a 
            zero. Of the three female participants, all reported a decrease in stress level after playing the game. The highest 
            change in stress level was a difference of six while the lowest was a three.</p>
        <h1>Discussion</h1>
        <p>From this data alone, it is hard to say whether males or females got a greater relief from stress due to the lower 
            number of females who participated. It is also hard to say whether a higher stress level would lead to a greater 
            relief from stress. The only thing that can be concluded from the results is that the game did provide relief from 
            stress for almost seventy percent of participants.</p>
